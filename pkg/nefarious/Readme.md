# Nefarious
This package is intended to perform more "Execution" phase actions within a Pentest or Red-Team engagement.

Since this is a tool for legitamate use, best effort is made to ensure destructive actions are mitigated. However, different environments and edge-cases may cause unexpected results

`Any ShellCode within this project will only trigger beneign apps such as our trusty Calculator`


## Assumptions
These actions of course assume that you are able to get this binary on disk somewhere and execute.

Many of the actions may require elevated privileges.

Since these are optional, running the binary a couple times might be beneficial. Once for PrivEsc oportunities, and once you have higher privleges.

## Windows Enhanced (Actions)
Inspired by multiple RedTeam focused projects.
